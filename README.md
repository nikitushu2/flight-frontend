This project is a flight diary web application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It allows users to create and view flight diary entries, where each entry contains a date, visibility conditions (great, good, ok, poor), and weather conditions (sunny, rainy, cloudy, stormy, windy). The frontend communicates with a backend API running on localhost:3000 using Axios for HTTP requests. Users can add new diary entries through a form with date inputs and radio button selections for visibility and weather, and view all existing entries displayed chronologically.
